    About me
  </h2>
  <p>
    Throughout my studies, I have developed a deep passion for mobile and web development, machine learning, and computer vision. 
    While Iâ€™m still relatively new to the world of programming, I always try to expand my knowledge and skills and constantly seek new challenges and opportunities to grow.
    Outside of programming, I enjoy learning new languages (currently studying French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·), visiting art galleries and playing tennis or skiing.
